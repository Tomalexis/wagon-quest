<details><summary>Game Rules</summary>
The game is a parody of the coding Bootcamp named Le Wagon in Paris and is centered around "flashcards battles".
The player will face teachers from Le Wagon who will ask them questions regarding some of the bootcamp's classes such as Ruby, CSS/Bootstrap, Javascript or Rails.

The player has to choose between four different answers to each question. The player wins by depleting all the teacher's HP to 0.
If the player gives too many wrong answers, his HP will reach 0 and he will have to play the fight back from the beginning.

Finally, there's a hidden fight in the lower left corner of the second map which features different game mechanics where you have to type the answer instead of selecting it from a list of four choices.
